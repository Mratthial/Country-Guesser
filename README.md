# Country-Guesser
Welcome to my first public project!  

For this project, I first made a website scraper following a tutorial made by Python: Zero to Mastery (ZTM) by Andrei Nagoi.  
Based on this tutorial, I decided to scrape the data off of a website with every country that is internationally recognized.
This tested my skills on how to scrape the data.

I then went on to design a fun little game where the player attempts to guess a country picked at random, out of a dictionary of 190+ countries.
The player is asked to guess the country based on how many letters there are.  The player is displayed a "hangman-like empty word" boxes to help.
The player is then given an opportunity to guess.  If the guess is wrong, a hint is given to aid the guessing.  
After 5 incorrect guesses, the game ends! The player is told the name of the Answer.

This game may have updates to increase the types of dictionaries that are used to guess from!

This code is my intelectual property.  It has had guidence from ZTM and ChatGPT version 3.5.  Inspiration from ChatGPT 3.5 is promptly commented on the regions where used for assistance.
